mod3_1-1000.gp has a list of
  [conductor, list of octic polynomials]
for conductors from 1 to 1000 for the irreducible mod-3 representations.

Notes:
  - 8T23 fields come in twin pairs, so there are two polynomials for each
    such representation
  - D_4 fields are given by an irreducible octic while one might want each
    represented as a product of two quartic D4's

Allmod3 is a magma data file for all irreducible GL(2,3) representations
with conductor <= 1000 in the form <polynomial, conductor, top slope>.  The
8T23 fields have just one per twin pair.  D_4's are given as octics.

Q8.3 has all Q_8 fields where the mod 3 representation has conductor <=1000
