SL25-to-1000 is complete for conductors up to 75 assuming GRH
It has all examples with conductor <=101 pulled from A_5 fields in 
the LMFDB at the time of computation.

Cn.5.m has cyclic fields with conductor <= 1000 where the representation
is irreducible

The following do the same for the corresponding groups:

S3.5.m
D4.5.m
Q8.5.m
D6.5.m
C3C4.5.m
