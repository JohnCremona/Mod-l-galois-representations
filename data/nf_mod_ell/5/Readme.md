SL25-to-1000 is complete for conductors up to 75 assuming GRH
It has all examples with conductor <=101 pulled from A_5 fields in 
the LMFDB at the time of computation.

Q8.5 has all Q_8 fields where the mod 5 conductor is <= 1000

Cn.5.m has cyclic fields with conductor <= 1000 where the representation
is irreducible

S3.5.m has S_3 cubics with mod 5 conductor <=1000
